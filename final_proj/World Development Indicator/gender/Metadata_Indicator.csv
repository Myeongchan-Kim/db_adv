SE.PRM.NENR.FE,Net enrolment rate; primary; female (%),Total number of female students in the theoretical age group for primary education enrolled in that level; expressed as a percentage of the total female population in that age group. Divide the number of female students enrolled who are of the official age group for primary education by the female population for the same age group and multiply the result by 100. NER at each level of education should be based on enrolment of the relevant age group in all types of schools and education institutions; including public; private and all other institutions that provide organized educational programmes. A high NER denotes a high degree of coverage for the official school-age population. The theoretical maximum value is 100%. Increasing trends can be considered as reflecting improving coverage at the specified level of education. When the NER is compared with the GER; the difference between the two highlights the incidence of under-aged and over-aged enrolment. If the NER is below 100%; then the complement; i.e. the difference with 100%; provides a measure of the proportion of children not enrolled at the specified level of education. However; since some of these children/youth could be enrolled at other levels of education; this difference should in no way be considered as indicating the percentage of students not enrolled. To measure universal primary education; for example; adjusted primary NER is calculated on the basis of the percentage of children in the official primary school age range who are enrolled in either primary or secondary education. A more precise complementary indicator is the Age-specific enrolment ratio (ASER) which shows the participation in education of the population of each particular age; regardless of the level of education.,UNESCO Institute for Statistics

SE.PRM.REPT.FE.ZS,Percentage of repeaters in primary education; all grades; female (%),Total number of female students enrolled in the same grade as in the previous year; expressed as a percentage of all female students enrolled in primary school. It is calculated by dividing the sum of female repeaters in all grades of primary education by the total female enrolment of primary education and multiplying the result by 100. The definition of repeaters should be unambiguously applied to include even pupils repeating more than once in the same grade and those who repeat the same grade while transferring from one school to another. Students who were not studying in the same grade in the previous year should be excluded.,UNESCO Institute for Statistics
SE.PRM.REPT.MA.ZS,Percentage of repeaters in primary education; all grades; male (%),Total number of male students enrolled in the same grade as in the previous year; expressed as a percentage of all male students enrolled in primary school.

SE.PRM.TCHR.FE.ZS,Percentage of teachers in primary education who are female (%),Number of female teachers at the primary level expressed as a percentage of the total number of teachers (male and female) at the primary level in a given school year. Teachers are persons employed full time or part time in an official capacity to guide and direct the learning experience of pupils and students; irrespective of their qualifications or the delivery mechanism; i.e. face-to-face and/or at a distance. This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters; headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.,UNESCO Institute for Statistics
SE.PRM.TENR.FE,Adjusted net enrolment rate; primary; female (%),Total number of female students of the official primary school age group who are enrolled at primary or secondary education; expressed as a percentage of the corresponding female population. Divide the total number of female students in the official primary school age range who are enrolled in primary or secondary education by the female population of the same age group and multiply the result by 100. NERA should be based on total enrolment of the official primary school participation age group in primary and secondary education for all types of schools and education institutions; including public; private and all other institutions that provide organized educational programmes (pre-primary education must be excluded). NERA gives more precise measure of the participation of the official primary school age population to the education system (excluding pre-primary education). It reflects the actual level of achievement of the Universal Primary Education (UPE) goal. In fact; while the Net enrolment rate (NER) shows the coverage of pupils in the official primary school age group in the primary education level only; the NERA extends the measure to those of the official primary school age range who have reached secondary education because they might access primary education earlier than the official entrance or they might skip some grades due to their performance. Increasing NERA might mirror improving participation of children in the official primary school age; the decrease of the target population or both. A value of 100% indicates theoretically that the country has accomplished the UPE goal. However; this condition is not sufficient for UPE due to; for example; a high repetition rate; which might lead pupils to dropout after primary school age without completing primary education. The difference between NERA and NER provides a measure of the proportion of children in the official primary age group who are enrolled in secondary education.,UNESCO Institute for Statistics
SE.PRM.TENR.MA,Adjusted net enrolment rate; primary; male (%),Total number of male students of the official primary school age group who are enrolled at primary or secondary education; expressed as a percentage of the corresponding male population.

","Number of female students admitted to the first grade of a higher level of education in a given year; expressed as a percentage of the number of female students enrolled in the final grade of the lower level of education in the previous year. Divide the number of new female entrants in the first grade of the specified higher cycle or level of education by the number of female pupils who were enrolled in the final grade of the preceding cycle or level of education in the previous school year; and multiply by 100. High transition rates indicate a high level of access or transition from one level of education to the next. They also reflect the intake capacity of the next level of education. Inversely; low transition rates can signal problems in the bridging between two cycles or levels of education; due to either deficiencies in the examination system; or inadequate admission capacity in the higher cycle or level of education; or both. This indicator can be distorted by incorrect distinction between new entrants and repeaters; especially in the first grade of the specified higher level of education. Students who interrupted their studies for one or more years after having completed the lower level of education; together with the migrant students; could also affect the quality of this indicator.
